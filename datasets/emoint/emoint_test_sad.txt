@executivegoth I tried a free Alpha trial to watch #dread and I'm sold. Worth the subscription alone. You all are incredible!
@villodotexe This is the most fucking cursed FEHeroes unit I've ever had the displeasure of seeing
Watching #ScottishOpenHeroChallenge from last night... Smoke, flames, tense sound effects and lively commentary.. #boring #dull #shite 🙈
That moment when people say you don't need medicine, it's mind over matter. You need to stop doing that. #bipolar

@MaisieeeH I think the ending is about despair, and about not being able to escape the system... maybe?
I woke up too moody who gon Die today 😠
What is this inane waffling nonsense that @BBCSport @bbctennis is forcing us to endure every time John Inverdale takes the mic. #dreadful
The more Russia stuff I watch, the more I think Clinton was setting Trump up for a legal attack after she was Prez.

If your nail polish has hardened or is gummy, place the bottle in a pan of boiling water. The polish will be like new.
Hmmmm. Seems we only had 14 punters vote in #S20Cup. 163 followers and only 14 punters at the track. #disappointing :(
@ComfortablySmug @allahpundit Exactly, we are supposed to believe what a Russian operative in American soil says. Beyond depressing.
It bugs me that people concern themselves so much with what other people CHOOSE to do with their money 😂🙈
My soon to be ex wife needs to learn to chill out &amp; smile
